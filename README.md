# CAPS
CAPS IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CREATED TO MINIMIZE HAND MOVEMENTS DURING CODING, WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS ON ENHANCING COMFORT.

FOR THAT **MOST OF THE SIGNALS WILL BE TYPED** (DON'T WORRY, IT IS ALL VERY INTUITIVE) AND, OF COURSE, **ALL THE WORDS MUST BE IN CAPITAL LETTERS**, TO AVOID THE NEED TO SHIFT BETWEEN CASES. 

SO POSITION YOUR HANDS COMFORTABLY ON THE KEYBOARD, AND ENJOY THE SEAMLESS CODING EXPERIENCE THAT ONLY CAPS PROVIDES.

### BRIEF DOCUMENTATION:

**VARIABLES:**

INPUT
```
VAR X INT
VAR Y INT = 100
X IS 10

VAR A STR
VAR B STR = "I LOVE CAPS"
A IS "CAPS IS LAZY"
```

**CONDITIONS:**

INPUT
```
IF X EQUALS 10 DO
  PRINT OPEN A CLOSE
DOT ELSE DO
  PRINT OPEN B CLOSE
DOT
```

OUTPUT
```
CAPS IS LAZY
```

> [!NOTE]
> COMPARING TO GoLang:
>
> "DO" = "{"
>
> "DOT" = "}"
>
> "OPEN" = "("
>
> "CLOSE" = ")"

**LOOPS:**

INPUT
```
GIVEN I IS 0 WHILE I LESS 5 WITH I IS I PLUS 1 DO
  PRINT OPEN X PLUS I CLOSE
DOT
```

OUTPUT
```
10
11
12
13
```

> [!NOTE]
> COMPARING TO GoLang `for`, "GIVEN" IS THE INIT PART, "WHILE" IS THE CONDITION AND "WITH" IS THE INCREMENT 

### HOW TO RUN IT?
  1. GO TO THE _Compiler_ FOLDER
  2. CODE IN A _.txt_ FILE
  3. IN THE TERMINAL RUN `python main.py NAME_OF_FILE.txt`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> THERE IS AN EXAMPLE/TEST IN THE _Compiler_ FOLDER CALLED _input.txt_, WHERE ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITIES ARE PRESENTED
